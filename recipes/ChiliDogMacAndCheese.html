    <h1>Chili Dog Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/ChilliCheeseDogMacNCheese.jpeg" alt="Mac and cheese" width="600" height="300">
    <p>
        I can't really explain why I decided to create this chili dog mac and cheese 
        <br> I always get a few requests for comforting casseroles this time of year,
        <br>but if the goal was to end up with a recipe that tasted like both things,
        <br>I failed miserably. On the other hand, if a tasty, comforting casserole 
        <br>was the mission, then let's celebrateâ€¦and invite a few friends, since 
        <br>this thing is huge. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While I did enjoy eating this, I was a bit confused why it didn't really taste
        <br>like chili dogs or mac and cheese. I knew the lack of creamy sauce might be an
        <br>issue, but I thought if I stirred in enough cheese, all would be fine. Taste 
        <br>and texture-wise, I was correct, but the flavors just didn't come together as
        <br>I'd hoped. Anyway, I tried, and failed, but also kind of succeeded, and if 
        <br>you'd like something that feels and tastes like an American goulash with 
        <br>hot dogs, then I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat.
            <br>Add beef; cook and stir, breaking up with a spoon or spatula,
            <br>about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring, 
            <br>until beef is crumbly, and onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon,
            <br>cayenne, dried oregano, and garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add peppers, sliced hot dogs, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir together;
            <br>bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring
            <br>occasionally, until cooked to your taste, at least 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Once chili is nearly ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring
            <br>to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered,
            <br>stirring occasionally, 1 minute less than specified in package directions, 
            <br>until not quite tender, and still firm to the bite, about 8 to 11 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Turn off heat under chili, drain macaroni, and add to the pot of chili. Stir 
            <br>until combined, and transfer mixture into a large, deep (15x10-inch) baking dish.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Mix Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses together in a bowl, and transfer about 60% 
            <br>of cheese to top of chili mixture. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix cheese into the 
            casserole.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Apply remaining cheese evenly over the top, and lightly poke down into 
            <br>the surface with the tip of a spoon.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.
            <br>Let rest 15 minutes before serving, topped with green onions.
        </li>
    </ol>
